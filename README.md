This is a code learning exercise by creating the Tetris game.

Use the 'Start/Pause' button to start and pause the game.  Play continues until the tetrominoes (play pieces) build up to the top of the play area, which is the traditional game over condition for tetris.

Arrow keys are used to play the game.  Left and right move the tetrominoes left and right respectively.  The down arrow advances pieces quicker.  The up arrow is used to rotate the tetromino.

The right square is the next tetromino that will fall after the current one is placed.
